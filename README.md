# Julia Function Bug
This repository demonstrates a bug in a Julia function that produces unexpected results for negative input values. The function is designed to return the square of positive numbers and 0 for non-positive numbers, but it currently returns unexpected outputs for negative inputs. The solution provides a corrected version of the function that addresses this issue.
